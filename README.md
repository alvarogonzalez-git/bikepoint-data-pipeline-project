# TfL's API - BikePoint Data Pipeline

This project was completed as a part of The Information Lab's Data Engineering School. It was incrementally developed on a weekly basis by applying the core skills that correspond to the main stages in the Data Engineering lifecycle: Extract, Transform and Load (ETL). This readme is divided into sections that provide more detail on each stage of development

* Extract - ingesting data via API call in python script 🐍
* Transform
* Load

## Extract
This project uses BikePoint data for Transport for London's Santander Cycles. They make this data available via their Unified API. The data was ingested using the following python script - `bikepoint_api_call.py`.

### bikepoint_api_call.py
This script calls the API and writes a .json file into our data folder. The script has robust error handling and logging features to allow monitoring of the scripts performance.
